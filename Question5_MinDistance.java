// Question 5: Closest distance between duplicate minimums
//
// Analogy:
// Two premier league games are being played,I am trying to find the **shortest walking distance**
// between repeated (same city teams/derbies) cities. Four teams in the same city playing on the same day = two derbies.
// Each location has a budget tag, and you're trying to find two **identical cheapest locations to find my transport to the next derby**
// that are **closest to each other in case numerous other fans are thinking of watching both games like I am.** in the
// schedule.
// This helps minimize movement and cost â€” so the goal is to find the minimum distance between
// two equal, lowest-cost options.
//
// If there's only one cheapest location, there's no distance to compare, so the answer remains `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
