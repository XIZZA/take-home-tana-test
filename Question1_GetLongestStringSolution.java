// Question 1: Get Longest Unique Character Substring
//
// Analogy:
// You're organizing an action movie marathon. But there's a twist â€” you don't want to repeat any actor
// (like not repeating characters in a string). You want the **the longest sequence** of back-to-back movies
// with completely unique actors. As soon as an actor appears again, the current streak ends,
// and you restart from the next new actor.
//
// The algorithm helps you find the longest such non-repeating actor streak.
